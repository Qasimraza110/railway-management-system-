“RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”
Description:
We have a railway management system. It operates trains on various routes and aims to provide efficient and reliable transportation services to its passengers. Passengers can book tickets through the Ticket Booking System by providing their personal information, selecting the desired train and route, and specifying the number of tickets needed. The system generates a ticket with details such as the passenger's name, train details, route, booking date, seat number, and ticket price. It assigns staff members (such as drivers, conductors, and ticket inspectors) to specific trains based on their availability and expertise. Staff members are responsible for ensuring the safety and comfort of passengers during the journey. It maintains information about various routes, including the start and end stations, distance, and estimated duration of travel. Stations are equipped with platforms, ticket counters, waiting areas, and other facilities to accommodate passengers. Passengers can view available trains, check ticket availability, and book tickets through the Ticket Booking System, either online or at station counters. The system provides passengers with real-time updates on train schedules, delays, and platform announcements. Passengers can manage their booked tickets, including canceling tickets if needed. The system keeps track of passenger ticket history and preferences, allowing for personalized services and promotions.
